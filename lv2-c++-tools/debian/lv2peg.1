.SH NAME
lv2peg \- program that generates C header files from Turtle files containing LV2 plugin data.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B lv2peg
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBlv2peg\fP program that generates C header files from Turtle files containing LV2 plugin data.
This is useful for keeping the RDF data and your source code synchronised while you are working on the plugin 
and maybe changing things like port types and ranges.  
.PP
By including the generated file in the source code for your plugin and setting up your build system to regenerate it 
when the RDF file changes, you can change the port indices, the ranges and default values, 
the plugin URI etc without having to update your code manually.
