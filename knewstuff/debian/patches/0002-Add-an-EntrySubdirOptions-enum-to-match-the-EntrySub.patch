Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Add an EntrySubdirOptions enum, to match the EntrySubdir
 option

This intends to partner up the AuthorSubdir option with a matching
option for the entries themselves, allowing you to install entries into
a subdir of their own. You can mix and match, or you can have just the
entry in a subdir, with no author (though in that case, recommending to
use nameandid).
